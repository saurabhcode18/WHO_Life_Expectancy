Life Expectancy Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict Life Expectancy using WHO global health indicators. The goal is to understand the strongest factors influencing longevity and build an accurate regression mode

Model Performance:
After training and evaluating the model on real-world WHO data, the results are:

Metric	Score:
R² Score =	0.8093

MAE	≈ 2.9606


Interpretation:
The model explains 80.9% of the variation in life expectancy across countries
